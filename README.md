## Project "Spring Restaurant" :mortar_board:
###Used frameworks: Spring MVC, Hibernate, JSP

The main target of this project is to show how we can use Spring MVC with Hibernate.
I think that this project can help **beginners** to understand in which way we connect Spring MVC (JSP view) and Hibernate framework.
I have made it, because I had problems with understanding things described above.

Enjoy it :shipit:
